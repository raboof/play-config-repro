* `sbt -Dconfig.file=conf/someconf.conf` produces a NoClassDefFound on startup
* `sbt -Dconfig.file=/someconf.conf` doesn't
* moving the config to application.conf doesn't

Probably -Dconfig.file adds the config to the configuration of the Play devmode
actorsystem instead of (or in addition to) the application configuration.
